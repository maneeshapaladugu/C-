/*Program to illustrate virtual function*/

/*In a Runtime polymorphism, functions are called at the time of program execution. Hence, it is known as late binding or dynamic binding.*/

/*A virtual function is a member function which is declared within a base class and is re-defined(Overriden) by a derived class. When you refer to a derived class object using a pointer or a reference to the base class, you can call a virtual function for that object and execute the derived classâ€™s version of the function. */

/* Basically, a virtual function is used in the base class in order to ensure that the function is overridden. 
This especially applies to cases where a pointer of base class points to an object of a derived class.
