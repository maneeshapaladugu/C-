/*
  Program to implement Singleton design pattern

  Singleton is a creational design pattern that lets you ensure that a class has only one instance,
  while providing a global access point to this instance.

  The Singleton class defines the 'GetInstance' method that serves as an alternative
  to constructor and lets clients access the same instance of this class over and over.
  
  Why would anyone want to control how many instances a class has? 
  The most common reason for this is to control access to some shared resourceâ€”for example, a database or a file.
